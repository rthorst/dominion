--> Recognize combos present (from a combos list)
--> Easier inputting cards (from text?)

Combos:

1) Extract list of 2-card combos from here:
http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Combos_and_Counters_List

2) As the user enters cards, automatically identify combos that are 
present.

3) Print them below the main dataframe.
